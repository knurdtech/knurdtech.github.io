## Disclosure and Terms of Use


Assume any links found on KnurdTech.com are affiliate links. That means that any link on this site could (and very well is) there to make money for the owners of the site.

Having said that, we try to be as truthful and honest as possible regarding reviews on KnurdTech.com. We will disclose if any product was received for free or any other compensation was received.

In most cases, the products reviewed here were purchased with our own money. The only compensation we receive is a small affiliate commission if an affiliate link (almost any link on this site) is clicked and a subsequent purchase is made on that site.

We typically review items or services of interest to the writers and owners of KnurdTech.com.  It is important to understand that every reasonable attempt is made to communicate the benefits and drawbacks to a product.  However, since we are writing about things we truly love...sometimes the reviews may come off a bit too positive.  It is always up to the reader to conduct your own diligent research on products or services reviewed here before purchasing.
