### Features they have in common:

Nokia is making a new run at the US market with the Windows Phone 7 "Mango" OS. While Nokia is very well known in other countries for building quality phones, it has been awhile since they have had an impact in the states. We are analyzing the differences between the Lumia 710, Lumia 800, and soon to be released Lumia 900. First up, what they all have in common.
	
  * Processor: 1.4 GHz Snapdragon S2
  * Graphics: Qualcomm Adreno 205
  * Memory: 512 MB SDRAM
  * Screen: Capacitive touch with ClearBlack technology and Gorilla glass
  * Resolution: 480 x 800 WVGA
  * Camera: All include a rear facing camera with autofocus though the specs vary

### Nokia Lumia 710

  * Mass memory (storage): 8 GB

### Nokia Lumia 800
	
  * Display: 3.7 inch AMOLED PenTile
  * Camera: 8 MP Carl Zeiss optics with f/2.2 aperture and dual LED flash

  * Mass memory (storage): 16 GB

### Nokia Lumia 900
	
  * Display: 4.3 inch AMOLED RGB
  * Data: 4G LTE
  * Camera (rear): 8 MP same specs as Lumia 800
  * Camera (front): 1 MP for video calling
  * Battery: 1830 mAh capable of 7 hours talk, 300 h standby, 60 h music playback, or 6.5 h video playback
  * Mass memory (storage): 16 GB

### Summary and Conclusions

The Lumia 710 has a different body style than the 800/900. The Lumia 800 copies the Nokia N9 while the Lumia 900 looks similar but grows for the bigger screen.

Going from the Lumia 710 to Lumia 800 gains better looks (opinion), slightly better camera, a little bigger battery, and 8 GB additional storage. The extra storage may be important since none of these phones have an SD slot.

Moving from the Lumia 800 to the Lumia 900 you basically gain screen size, a front facing camera, and 4G LTE support. The larger battery benefit is mostly negated by the increased battery usage of the larger screen and possibly LTE. Although the screen resolution remains the same, the lack of PenTile subpixels makes it more clear on the larger display.

Ultimately it comes down to: Does a Windows Phone work for you?Â  Let me know!
