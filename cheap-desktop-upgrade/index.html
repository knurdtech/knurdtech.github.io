            <p>Finally bit the bullet and did a minor upgrade.  After exhaustive research I settled for a very low end system that is still two to four times faster than my old hardware.  More on that in a bit.  So without further ado, here are the parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ASUS M4A785TD-V EVO AM3 AMD 785G - $100</p></li>

<li><p>G.SKILL ECO Series 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) - $120</p></li>

<li><p>AMD Sempron 140 Sargas 2.7GHz Socket AM3 45W Single-Core Processor - $33</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All other parts were reused from my old system plus a SATA HDD that was lying around.  The budget was $300 which I could have come closer to but I&rsquo;m happy with these choices to hold me over.</p>

<p>Memory prices have increased a lot.  September 2009 had four gigs of memory hovering around $50.  This was by far the biggest expense but one not worth skimping on.  DDR3 was basically a starting point for all other parts.  The &ldquo;eco&rdquo; series basically runs at a lower voltage for more energy efficiency.  Now on to a motherboard and CPU that would support it.</p>

<p>Intel&rsquo;s Core &ldquo;i&rdquo; series are great CPUs but AMD still wins on a cost/performance basis.  AMD just released their <sup>880</sup>&frasl;<sub>890</sub> series chipsets but they don&rsquo;t add anything I need.  Since my old video card was AGP, it is now worthless in a new system.  So, something that is cheap but upgradeable with low-end graphics and dual-monitor support?  The 785G chipset!  It can easily be upgraded to better graphics later but works fine for now.  This was a really tough decision as a cheap Nvidia 210 or 220 would probably work better in Linux.</p>

<p>Then to top it all off, I gambled and got lucky.  The cheapest AM3 socket processor based on the &ldquo;regor&rdquo; core sometimes allows it to unlock to dual-core.  Mine does - basically turning it into an Athlon II X2 235e!  Granted, if you truly want dual-core you should spend the extra 25-30 bucks to get it guaranteed.  But I was already buying twice my old speed (Socket 754 Sempron 2800+ &ldquo;Palermo&rdquo;) with a chance of multitasking&hellip;can&rsquo;t complain either way.  Again, this is easily a part that can be upgraded/replaced later for a quad (or even hexa) core processor.  The goal of this system was simply a cheap upgrade with room to grow.</p>

<p>Update 06/22/2011: Looking to build now?  Get an AM3+ socket motherboard for compatibility with the new Bulldozer/Zambezi processors.  You can still keep it cheap by using an AM3 socket CPU for now.</p>
