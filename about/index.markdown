I love following technology, exploring linux, portable devices, networking, SIP/VOIP, lifehacks, gadgets, IPAs, porters, and stouts.

I don't build massive gaming rigs (and typically don't play computer games). When I do build or upgrade computers I'm usually more interested in performance per watt, idle power consumption, and noise levels. Just because I'm interested in those doesn't mean it happens. I like to reuse what is available and serves the purpose rather than throw out to waste.

Current gadgets:



	
  * HTPC (Atom ION 330) with Ubuntu 9.10 using XBMC and Boxee beta

	
  * <del>Nokia e71Â  (ARM1136J(F)-S)</del>

	
  * Samsung Galaxy S (Captivate)

        
  * Nokia 701

	
  * Desktop with Ubuntu (specs posted [here](http://www.knurdtech.com/cheap-desktop-upgrade/))

	
  * Core 2 Duo T5500 Laptop with Archbang Linux
