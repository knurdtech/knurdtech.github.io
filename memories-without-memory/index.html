            <p>Unless you feel nostalgic and want to take a ride down memory lane, stop reading now. This post is just reminiscing on old computers from the past.</p>

<p>So I ran across the receipts for computer builds previous to my <a href="/cheap-desktop-upgrade">cheap desktop upgrade</a> and had a good laugh.  This actually started in an effort to find details about my current PSU&hellip;which is almost the only detail missing.</p>

<p>To start with the recent desktop upgrade replaced an Abit KV8 Pro Socket 754 motherboard ($80) with an AMD Sempron 2800+ 1.6 GHz &ldquo;Palermo&rdquo; CPU ($87).  Memory configuration was 1 GB of Corsair DDR400 (PC3200) CAS2.5 &ldquo;value select&rdquo; ($92).  This looks like another build that was supposed to receive an upgrade and never did.  These parts were ordered March 30, 2005.  The graphics were provided by a Leaktek GeForce A6200 with 128 MB DDR ($125).  According to notes it was unlocked to a 6600 with all eight pixel pipelines!  Also at that time a 200 GB Ultra ATA/133 7200 RPM hard drive with 8 MB buffer cost $110 and an NEC ND-3520A 16x Double Layer DVD+-RW cost $66.  Total cost $560 but that is missing case and power supply.</p>

<p>Before that was a build around the end of August 2000 which included an Abit KT7-RAID ($164) and AMD 700 Thunderbird Socket-A CPU ($146).  A full ATX Apex case with 300 watt power supply for $62.  128 MB Mushkin &ldquo;high performance&rdquo; revision 2 PC133 RAM ($194).  Buckle up it starts getting crazy!  Creative 3D Blaster Annihilator 2 (video graphics) at $249 displaying to a 17&rdquo; Viewsonic PF775 monitor ($314).  Then a Creative Live Platinum 102 sound card ($165) pumping sound to Creative Fourpoint FPS2000 digital surround speakers ($117).  Also at the time an IBM 30 GB ATA/100 cost $139 (multiply by two for RAID) and a Pioneer 16x DVD rang in at $122.  Case fans and a CPU cooler added another $22.  The staggering total (after $122 of separate shipping costs) was just $1955.  Holy crap!</p>

<p>RAM prices fell by April of 2001 which led to an additional purchase of 256 MB (yes, it was up to 384 MB total) for $103.  Also according to notes the included PSU failed in that same month leading to a replacement $76 Turbo-Cool 300 ATX.  That &ldquo;Thunder-bird&rdquo; was up to $2134 by then.  Makes computers seem cheap nowadays.</p>

<p>The very last receipt found was for a build at the end of October 1998.  Oh joyous me.  This technology is so old it will just be a quick run through.  VIA VP-3 AGP P5 motherboard with AMD K6-<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>300</sub> MMX CPU combo ($225).  An astounding 64 MB of PC100 SDRAM ($89).  Matrix Millennium G200 8MB AGP video card ($115) and a PCI sound card ($39).  Brought together with a 10.1 GB IDE hard drive ($249) and a 1.44 MB floppy drive ($18).  Remember those things?  Oh the precious, expensive memories (no pun intended).  Now officially digitized on my blog&hellip;these relics are heading for the recycle bin.</p>
